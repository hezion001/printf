# printf
The printf function for the C programming language that this team created is called _printf. It has been enhanced to accept a variety of inputs and optional arguments exactly like the printf function in the standard library does. This was sent in as part of the assignment for the ALX software engineering course.


Without using any standard library files, the function _printf() outputs data to the standard output stream with the format and settings specified. While it can print larger data sets, it was designed to print from a local buffer of 1024 bytes.

After a successful execution, the _printf() method returns the total amount of characters sent to the stdout, excluding the null byte at the end of strings.

A negative value of -1 is returned in the event of an output error.

This function's prototype is: int _printf(const char format,...);

This means that it has a single format argument that must be present as well as an additional number of arguments that may be one or many.



Task 0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life: A function that produces an output according to a format.
Task 1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
Task 2. With a face like mine, I do better in print
Task 3. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print
Task 4. Nothing in fine print is ever good news
Task 5. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print
Task 6. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print
Task 7. The big print gives and the small print takes away
Task 8. Sarcasm is lost in print
Task 10. The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance
Task 11. It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print
